# Version Control Assignment: Git and GitHub Workflow

## 🚀 Project Summary

This repository was created to demonstrate fundamental version control skills required for the assignment. It covers the following key Git workflows:

* **Repository Setup:** Initializing Git locally and performing the first commit.
* **Remote Connection:** Linking the local repository to GitHub.
* **Branching & Merging:** Creating a `feature-update` branch for isolated work and successfully merging it back into the `main` branch.
* **Collaboration Simulation:** Using a Pull Request (`collab-update` branch) to simulate receiving and integrating external contributions.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The primary file used for tracking changes throughout the assignment process is:
